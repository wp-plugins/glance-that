Adds content control to At a Glance on the Dashboard

== Description ==

Glance That allows users to customize the content viewable in At a Glance on the WordPress Dashboard. Users can add/remove items from At a Glance, view items even if zero published posts exist, assign custom dashicons for their display, and sort the order of displayed items using drag & drop. Currently, the following items are supported ...

* Custom post types
* Revisions (admins only)
* Media
* Plugins
* Users
* Gravity Forms

Additionally, Glance That allows you to view the number of items matching the following statuses:

* Scheduled
* Pending
* Draft
* Private
* Trash
* Unattached (Media)
* Spam (Comments)
* Active, Inactive (Plugins & Gravity Forms)
* Updates (Plugins)

= Constants =

Statuses can be hid by adding the following to wp-config.php
`define( GT_SHOW_ALL_STATUS, FALSE );`

Items with a zero published count can be hid by adding
`define( GT_SHOW_ZERO_COUNT, FALSE );`

= Filters =

The `gt_default_glances` filter can be used to define glances that should be visible to a user upon first visiting their dashboard.
`apply_filters( 'gt_default_glances', array $default_glances, int $user_ID );`
where the $default_glances parameter is prepopulated as
`
// Define standard defaults
$gt_default_glances = array(
	'post' => array( 'icon' => 'f109', 'sort' => 1 ),
	'page' => array( 'icon' => 'f105', 'sort' => 2 ),
	'comment' => array( 'icon' => 'f101', 'sort' => 3 ),
	);
`
